Built a system to predict whether a news article shows a certain bias towards a particular group or political party
Used two parallel Convolutional Neural Networks followed by Batch Normalization and Max Pooling layers.
Used pre-trained contextualized Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers(BERT) Embeddings to represent each sentence into a vector.
Model achieved a highest accuracy of 0.81 and 0.79 on validation and test data respectively.
Tech stack used was Tensorflow, Keras, Numpy, Pandas, NLTK and Python.
